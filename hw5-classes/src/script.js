//Create a class that describes a regular marker. It should contain the following components: 
//1. A field that stores the color of the marker;
//2. A field that stores the amount of ink in the marker (in percentage);
//3. A method for input. The method takes a string and displays the text in the given color on the webpage. The text appears as long as the marker has ink. One non-space character takes 0,5% ink from the marker.
//4. Create a class that describes a refillable marker. The class should inherit from the regular marker. Also add a method that refills the marker. 
//Demonstrate the work of these methods.
